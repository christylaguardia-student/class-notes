Code Review
make sure only use id's for one element
when check if they answered yes or no, build something in if they give a totally different answer.
can use sometextelelment.innerhtml the console.log
button align, some default formatting form the browser, text-align center doesn't work
  .center-item {
    display: block;
    width: 100px;
    margin: 0 auto; //this is how you center
  }
  normally want to stay away from adding html to get formatting, could get out of hand
  css zengarden - same html with diff css
move script tag to bottom
put margin or padding on body not html
padding: top bottom left right; (remember north east south west)
if...
result += ("<div class='crt'>Correct</div>");
else...
result += ("<div class=\"wrg\">Wrong</div>");


=========================
JavaScript - Arrays
Put all your values in one bucket

variables hold one value
arrays can hold many values, of any type, or other arrays (multi-dimensional)

it's an object, that isn't a number or a string

var names = new Array();
var classes = new Arrays(5);

filling an array - one at a time or all at once

var names = new Array();
names[1] = "Mark";
names[2] = "John";
this array has null in first element

var names = new Array("Mark","John");
                      mark is names[0]
                              john is names[1]

location where values are kept are called elements
use square brackets to specify an element

Arrays start at element 0 (or old people call it index)

place the array as one of the objects within another array
reference the values with double sq brackets

var names = new Array(
new Array("Mark","Fitzgerald"),
new Array("John","Doe"),
new Array("Jane","Citizen"));

alert(names[][]


===========================
CSS - The Box Model - how CSS works with elements in a web page
How Elements are Drawn

everything is a box

p {
  width: 500px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 3px solid green;
  margin: 15px; /* margins dont effect box width, spaceing between other things*/
}

Box Sizing - CONTENT box or BORDER box
so like how much space is keft for the content

Inline
  Flows with text, even wrapping to lines below
  Dimensions cannot be set
  top and bottom margins are ignored
  <a>,<img>,<span>
Block
  Takes up entire width (nothin on sides)
  Dimensions can be set
  Can constrain
  <p>,<div>,<h1> these go entire width of the page
Inline-Block (hybrid)
  Flows with text, unless dimensions are set
  Can sit next to other inline or inline-block elements
  two <p> wont sit next to eachother unless you make inline bock

===========================
HTML Forms
Sending data to the server

Input field
Radio buttons
Checkboxes
Button
Scrollable list
Dropdown list
Free-form text

each item has a value that is sent to the server

<input>
type="text"
enables the sending text to server
no limit of text (unless specified)

type="radio"
mutually exclusive
button exclusivity is based upon its name

type="checkbox"
enable multiple choices
value sent only if the button is checked

type="submit"
automatically send data

type="reset" resets forms
type="button" used for associating javascript

...more input/type options...

value="" attribute 'controls' everything

List objects: <select>
Choice is sent to the server
Use <option> to specify list items

List objects: <select>
same as dropdown except number of lines displayed on screen
more options cause scrollbar to show

Free-form Text: <textarea>
use in times where a lot of text is to be entered
ending tag required - pre-fill text goes between tags
content is still access by its value attribute in javascript

binding tag: <form>
objects belong to a form
action attribute specifies resulting page to display
method attribute determines how data is sent
think fence
all the objects value get sent to server as one set of data
