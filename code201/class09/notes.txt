readMeH3s.find(function(element){return (element.textContent=="Class 9")})

==============
CSS Positioning
static - normal rendering, position statements have no effect, can use when want to inherit
relative - based on starting position
absolute - uses top-left corner of parent
fixed - placed as specific within the browser, uses top-left corner of window

position (top, bottom, left, right)
margin (negative #s ok) will effect other items on page
padding (only positive #s) space between content and border

==============
CSS Selectors
Specifying which elements to style

  Descendent
  nav a {color: red;}

  Child
  ul > li {color: yellow;}

  Sibling
  li + li {color: green;}

Specificity - more general to specific
  tag name
  class / attribute
  ID


ID + Class + Tag = total

==============
