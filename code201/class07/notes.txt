  inline
  inline-block

  h1
  p
  div
  ol,ul
  a
  img

HTML5 tags
  <header> container of header items
  <section> container of related content
  <article> content this self contained, this is the main part of whatever you're displaying, could stand as webpage by itself in terms of content
  <nav> holds items that make up navigation
  <aside> content related to article
*these are all block elements - basically, they are div tags with more descriptive names

(responsive design - one website, changes how displayed for each display - mobile first - desktop first)

  by id
  #menu {top: 200px}

changing how tags are displayed
each tag has default setting: block, inline or inline-block
tags are often changed to inline-block - to keep things inline, specify dimensions
sometimes inline items need to be block - images are inline by default (think like text)
hiding items by specifying display:"none"


=======================
don't add tags for css things
but add tags for the semantics


=======================
Building block of the DOM

DOM = document object model
defines the method of accessing objects and properties in a document
objects are referred to as nodes
nodes: root, parent, child, sibling
methods
  getElementsByTagName() - can use for part of page
  hasChildNotes()
  childNotes - returns list of nodes
  firstChild, lastChild, parentNode
  nextSibling,
  nodeValue - returns text in a node
  nodeName - name of the element
  nodeType

NodeTypes
 Element 1
 Attribute 2  <img src=""> img is 1, src is 2
 Text 3
 Document 9

DOM the tree
html is the root node (technically DOM is the root)
head & body are child of html, and siblings
body - header, section & nav are children of body, and siblings
