change img to div with
  background-image: url(img/.....jpg);
  background-size: auto 300px; //set height
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-color: white;
  background-position-x: 50%; //this will center it
then change click event to not use src attr, but look at style to get filename
lookup data attribute in html tag, use that as the product name instead of looking up the file name...


====================
JavaScript Local Storage

localStorage.setItem("key","the value you want to save");

localStorage.setItem("test","Hello World");
localStorage.getItem("test");

it's saved even when page is refreshed or browser is closed
it't specific to the website

must be a string, it will convert numbers to strings and give you string back


in console Application > Local Storage > File...
delete at the bottom
or localStorage.clear()


session storage is like local, but as soon as your browser tab goes away it's gone
local storage doesn't expire, it stays until you tell it to go away

window.localStorage - but don't have to use the window. just localStorage

if put array into localStorage, it'll return back a string, so use localStorage.getItem("arrayName").split(",");

if put object into localStorage, use JSON = "JavaScript Object Notation"

JSON.stringify(productsArray); // convert object to sting
localStorage.setItem("products", JSON.stringify(productsArray));
localStorage.getItem("products").split(","); // this doesn't work right
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("products").split(",")); // converts string back to object
then it returns as an object but not a Product object, so if theres methods you can use them


====================
