HTML Tempting system
- it is a template processor (executable code) together with a template specification
- the developer create a template that must comply with the template spec, the template contains common data & metadata & placeholders
- the template processors maps (processes & combines) data (like from a database) to the templates to from valid, usable web pages
- the HANDLEBARS template system is very common
- handlebars provide placeholders that are filled in with data when a handlebars.js is compiled

Typography
- its about utility, legibility & design
- typeface, ascdeder height, deceder height, …
	pixels = set hight
	em = set by nearest element
	rem = set by the body, "root em”
	***typically use the rem, em ok too

1em = 10px on default browser setting

Handlebars
you’ll need to get the script tag
this is the template
<script id=“template” type=“text/x-handlebars-template”>
   <p>{{ title }}</p>
   <p>{{ name }}</p>
   <p>{{ age }}</p>
   <p>{{{ favorite }}}</p>
</script>

{{ double curly braces are for text ***use this most of the time***
{{{ triple is if you have html in it already

then your object KEYS MUST MATCH, use the same properties (i.e. title, name)
var myobj = {
	title: ‘Ms.’,
	name: ‘Christy’,
	age: 30,
	favorite: ‘<h1>Charlie</h1>’
};


this will use jQuery to get by id and get all the html code
$(‘#template’).html();

to use handlebars:
1) give it a template
2) then it gives you a function
3) and then you feed the function it data

____________________

String Concatenation
use +
backtick `
es6 template file (the way of the future), works in node and chrome but not ie9

` and $ DO NOT MEAN JQUERY

{{	}} these are delimiters

${{`	`}}
