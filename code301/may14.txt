SQL Joins and Relationships

with mongodb you don't need to know what your data looks like, ie schema, is flexable

FK REFERENCE
person_id INTEGER REFERENCES person(person_id)

inner join, typically can just use join

1:1
1:many (can use crows feet or *)
many:many

when having many:many, must have a intermediate table

self referencing table for tree
|_parent
	|_child1
	|_child2
		|_subchild1
