Functional Programming

JavaScript programs start with programs, not class

what is it?
- immutability (vaiables don't varry, once you set it stays)
- declarative vs imperative code
- stateless (pure) functions
- first-class functions and currying

most of what we'll do - have array and call methods

but array methods don't mutate the data

---> look for opportunites to remove changing a variables value

react uses functional programming


array functions
.forEach
.filter
.reduce


arrow functions
let foo => () console.log('hello world');
