Client-server architecture

NodeJS
npm is package manager for node
follow the express framework tutorial on tutorials point

npm install express

express is your web server
need to have package.json file for new npm project

npm init

npm will then install a bunch of packages under node_modules folder
if gets corrupt you can delete
npm install body-parser --save

localhost is you computer
127.0.0.1 is your computer’s ip address
8081 is the port
3000 is typically then port for express

to start server
node server.js
 
to kill server
ctrl+c



REPL = Read Eval Print Loop


node hello.js
this cmd will run the js file in the terminal


```
‘use strict’
const express = require(‘express’)
const app = express()
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000 // if this port doesn’t exist, make it

app.use(express.static(‘./public’))

app.get(‘/‘, function(request, response) {
	if (request.body.username === ‘foo’ && request.body.password === ‘secret’) {
		response.sendFile(‘./public/index.html’)
	} else {
		
	}
})

```




posting form to server

to start server
npm start

use body-parser library

npm install body-parser —-save




public folder is anything running on client
basically unless its in this folder, it’s running on the server
app.get(‘/‘, function(request, response) {
	response.sendFile(‘./public/index.html’)
})
