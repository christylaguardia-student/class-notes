REST & APIS

*REST is the CRUD over HTTP

REST = representational state transfer
HTTP = like GPS for knowledge, apply VERB to NOUN
URL = uniform resource locator, points to the representation of a resource
Web page = represntation of some info in HTML

XML-RPC/SOAP (OLD DONT USE THIS ANYMORE)
same method, varing endpoints
GET /getComment
GET /getComments
GET /addComment

vs.

RESTful routes
HTTP method + resourse
GET /comments/:id
GET /comments
POST /comments

each endpoint is a route, made of noun and verb

HTTP is stateless
	- reqs dont have memory
	- no individual req may be asuumed to know anything abut any other req
	- all reqiured info representing the possible actions to take should be present in ever reponse
	- hypermedia: here's the thing you asked for, here's what you can do next

APP STATE AND TRANSITION
GET: asks for the current state
POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE: chages the state
PATCH is like a partial put

state -> transition -> state -> transition -> state

curl --version

curl === $.ajax()
curl is an ajax call

gihub api
Basic
OAuth Token

example

curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com


curl -H "Authorization: token fe57f0b05cdb22fbc50a39738c8b3f9750419128" https://api.github.com "https://api.github.com/user/repos?type=owner"


github will reject any commits with tokens, and it will trash your token

so we need a file that has the tokens what will be ignored by github

.gitignore


make file githubtoken.js
var githubToken = 'fe57f0b05cdb22fbc50a39738c8b3f9750419128';
