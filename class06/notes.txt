Code Review
create a generic function to analyze the user's answer
document.theNameOfYourForm.elements[theNameOfYourElement].value;


======================
JavaScript Objects
variables - hold one value
arrays - hold many items, even mix of items
objects - hold many variables, contains many functions

initialization with empty block or use new Object()
var student = {};
var instructor = new Object();

variables = properties with [] or dot syntax
student["name"] = "John Doe";
instructor.name = "Jane Expert";

functions = method, syntax of declaration is reversed
student.sayGreeting = function() {
  alert("Hello, I'm " + student.name);
}
student.sayGreeting();

*can have many variables in object and functions

this is object literal -assigning values right away
var student = {
  name: "John Doe";
  sayGreeting: function() {
    alert("Hello. I'm + this.name");
  }
}
