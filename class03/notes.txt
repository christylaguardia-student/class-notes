JavaScript

flow control - how to make some blocks of code execute at certain time

if (condition)
  more true/false in nature
  executes code when condition is true
  else enables an either-or true-false execution
  multiple else statements acceptable
  single = that's assignment
  double == you're comparing
  triple === checks for identity or exactness
  != means not equal

  if () {

  } else if {

  } else {

  }

while (condition) another variation is the do while
  executes code when condition is false
  continually executes code until the condition is false

  while (condition) {
  // keep doing this until condition is false
  }

for (initialize; condition; increment)
  initialize a counter and any other variables, kinda like a place holder to keep count of the things
  evaluate the condition before each cycle
  increment (or decrement) counter variables accordingly

  for (var count=1; count<=10; count++) {
  // execute this block the specified number of times
  }

  can also use count--

Logical Operators

boolean
  true/false
  AND &&
    both values must be true
    true && true = true
    true && false = false
  OR ||
    either value can be true
    true || true = true
    true || false = true
    false || false = false
  NOT !
    reverses value to it's opposite
    !false = true
operator
  numeric
logical operators
  numeric
  string

truthy and falsy
  0, nothing
  1, something
  blank text, nothing


====================
HTML Tables

think spreadsheet - rows, cells, columns are mult stacked cells
<table>
<tr> row
<td> cell
<th> header

merging cells
horizontal
  colpan = number of cells
vertical
  rowspan = number of rows
  it will impact the other <td>'s

====================
GIT Branching

git branch
  * is the current branch

git checkout -b class-03
  -b to make a new branch, make sure in the branch you want copy

git push origin class-03
