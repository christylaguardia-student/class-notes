Web application
client server

MVC
Model - html - content
View - CSS - presentation
Controller - javascript - interaction/logic

Web Surfing
browser requests page from server
serve finds and sends to browser
domain name lookup
http://www.cnn.com
	com - top level domain
	cnn - second level domain
	www - subdomain (make up what ever you want, i.e. store.mybusiness
convert domain name to ip address ex. 192.198.0.115 unique address to site
server knows to send …./index.html
	like directories
	www.cnn.com/
			2017/
				TECH/
					html.html
web server is glorified file server
important to organize, as site grows

Web Page
not a formatted word doc
they are built each time they’re viewed
	- text, positioning color…
	- graphics, positioning, scaling…
	- dependent on browser

HTML
html5
hyper text markup language
tags/elements
	surround content
	most tags have ending (XHTML is HTML in XML format, XHTML is super really old)
	many tags have attributes
Rules:
	- even though ending tags are optional, you should include them
	- always use quotes for attributes
	- tags can be uppercase or lower, industry uses lower

<!DOCTYPE html> declaration, tells browser you’re doing html5
<html> required
	<head> meta information
	<title>Title</title> window name, also bookmark name
	<script></script> this is the javascript, doesn’t have to be here
	</head>
	<body> required
		content
	</body>
</html>

white space = space, tab, return
all show as one space, even multiple

right click view page source, is not same as inspect

<br> acts like a return, no ending tag, because not adding content, just visual
<p> automatically adds some space, can change space size with css
<h1> heading tag (not head or header)
	auto bold, auto size and auto line break before and after
	<h1> through <h6>
semantic markup is helpful for developers, search engines and screen readers
	like use h1, h2, etc appropriately to make it easier
special characters &reference;
	&	&amp;		ampersand
	(c)	&copy;	copywrite symbol
	tm	&trade;	trade mark symbol

JS
prompt(“the message you want”,”default response“);
