## Resume & LinkedIn
* don't need mailing address on resume, just city & state
* clean up long urls on paper resume
* profile statement
  * be really clear on what you do
  * include a soft skill strength (learning, fast past env, etc)
* be clear on what you're looking for "I am a full-stack developer looking to work in ..."
* ppl typically scan resume for 6-10, 30sec on a good day
* prioritize your skills on what you want in your next roll
* no need to list MS Office or day-to-day type tools
* list skills in order of stuff you want to be known for
* list projects on resume
  * clear and concise, *1-line description*
  * target projects on what job you're applying for
  * don't overload with every piece of code
  * examples
    * "Built a responsive single page application with Angular and Bootstrap"
    * "Wrote a modern authenticated back end using Express and MongoDB"
* work experience
  * include: title, organization, city & state, month & year
  * volunteer - direct outcome
  * not just paycheck jobs
  * relevant responsibilities
  * don't need to include everything
  * don't just discuss what you were tasked with, describe what you accomplished
  * use ownership based language
  * examples
    * "Created an API that allows users on a mobile device to submit timesheet information to our financials background"
    * "Employed jQuery to wrap and add new functionality to an exiting rich text editor widget"
* education
  * include: school name, city & state
  * don't need to put dates
  * shy away from using "Bootcamp" because 401 is more advanced
  * make sure you use "Certificate" and "Advanced"
  * eliminate word student

## Online Presence
* consistency is key!
* profile pics
* consistency header/background pics
* usernames, kinda less important now
* customize URLs when possible
* double-check privacy settings (visible on linkedin?)
(think of yourself as a product)

* stack overflow has a job board

update github about-me and descriptions for repos

create a more text-based version of resume for uploading, and a nicer formated one for face-to-face
