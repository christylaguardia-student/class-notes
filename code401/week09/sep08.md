## PDX Tech Crawl follow ups
* send email to ppl met last night, before connecting via linkedin
  * send email then right after connect
  * invite to presentations
  * use keywords, like `react`
* depends on interaction, might ask for another meeting like coffee
* don't be pushy, super chill, be flexible, thankful and not demanding

    * Buffer
      * NodeJS interface into binary data
      
* Events

    * end-to-end testing
    * dev and production used

* Mongoose ODM

* Authentication and User Management

* Deploy to Heroku

infrastructure as a service vs platform as a service

* React
  * JSX

* Redux

## Understanding the hiring viewpoint

* cognitive empathy
* job search requires working with others
* try to understand why

Technical Hiring Manager
* a role, not a person (could be many people)
  * who has the budget and how committed and/or tenuous is it?
  * who chooses?
  * identify trusted resources
    * dev leads, top performers
    * people the hiring manager wants more of
    * ask
      * what is your role on the team?
      * what's your history with the company?
* _all of them have plenty of other work to do_
* they want a hireable candidate so they can get back to work
* help them help you...
* why are they hiring?
  * replacement
    * find out what the old person do
    * you'll need to be at least as good
  * growth
    * more latitude for a team hire
    * but more picky
  * other reasons?
  * find the connection between this position and the company's strategic outlook
  * what's the level of urgency?
  * why is this position necessary? cash cow project? what's the return?

where will you be able to jump in 1, 3, or 6 months?

Red flags
* appearing generally unskilled
  * not understanding the basics of your first language of choice
    * `function foo[`
    * `someMethod(callbadk())`
  * not looking like a programmer
    * basic control flow (looping, if/else, function)
    * big o in time and space
    * basic data structure
* being sloppy
* not being able to talk about recent work in technical detail
* not having any recent work or projects to talk about
* not having technical interests (same as being interested in "everything")

Practice code-challenge problems, codewars.com 30-60 minutes/day

Spend at least 3-4 hours/day on github projects (small 1 x week, med 2 x week, large 1 x month)

*DO, DO, PRACTICE, PRACTICE*

don't review, practice

_*doing software development everyday, then you are a developer!*_


Resources:
* Value Simplicity
* Cracking the coding interview

Competency => Proficiency => Fluency

### Mindset: Be a Developer, Not a Job Seeker

Interviewing
* be honest and transparent
* be real and authentic
* know your strategy
  * does not mean divulging in all your shortcoming
  * frame yourself
  * (based on claiming your territory)
* act like a new hire (like you already work there)
* don't try to bluster or try to snow
* try not to speak generally, give examples
* answer based in real experience
  * "for example, in my last project I did it like this..."

when you don't know
* try to turn it into a conversation
* if you start a tech conversation, it's a win

ask how often do you release?
* CI: continuous integration
* CD: continuous development

technical debt: unclean/nasty code
