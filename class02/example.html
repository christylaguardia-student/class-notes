    <p>Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.</p>
    <p>That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10.<br>
      An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive.</p>
    <p>You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.</p>
    <p>My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women.</p>
    <p>You’re disgusting. I know words. I have the best words. We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before.</p>
    <p>I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text.</p>
    <p>Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. I know words. I have the best words. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.</p>
    <p>Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.</p>
    <p>My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before.</p>
