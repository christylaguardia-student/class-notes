Web application vs website
website is the umbrella
may have many web apps (js) in it

Attributes
graphics <img src=“logo.svg”>
	src is the attribute name
	“logo.svg” is the

hyper links <a href=“products.html”></a>
	href stands of hyperlink reference

File locations
	absolute references: http://….
	relative references: stat at current “images/logo.gif”
	never directly reference something on your own hard drive
	hierarchies
		to go from this
		http://www.cnn.com/2017/TECH/index.html
		to this
		http://www.cnn.com/2017/US/stocks.html
		do this
		<a href=“../US/stocks.html”>
		(just like in terminal) or you can write full path at root dir “/2017/US/stocks.html”
		but by using ../ if you move the TECH dir you don’t have to fix all the links

html/js are client side = they operate in the browser. images and such are on the server

images sometimes have border when you make a hyperlink, its a browser default like the hyperlink colors

Lists
<ol> ordered
<li> unordered
html bullets - disc, circle or square. but you can use an image instead
use type="A" for letters

====================
JavaScript
History
netscape started client-side scripting language named LiveScript
same time java support started
changed name to JavaScript
standardized version is called ECMAScript

<script></script>
you can have multiple of these
HTML comment tags aren't necessary (left over from old browsers)

<html>
	<head>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			//javascript goes here
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- html goes here -->
	</body>
</html>

javascript language components:
- variables are not explicitly typed
	- intended to be easy to just use var
	- variable can hold any type
	-
- control statements are just like regular programming
- end of statement = ";"
- blocks of code use {}

var today = new Date();
uses a date object

commands: alert, prompt, confirm
or can use forms

* Get information from the web page (form)
* Modify the web page (change content) e.g. static html to dynamic

myVar = myVar + 1 // standard method *works on strings
myVar += 1 				// shortcut method *works on strings
myVar++						// shorter shortcut, but only increments by 1

camel case = capitalize each letter of work except first word
best practice to write out full word - once you abbreviate, you over do it

developer tools > javascript console
type javascript then enter to run
type variable name and see the current values

====================
Terminal
pwd
cd
ls
ls -l
cat
touch
ls -a
	this will show hidden files
	. for current dir
	.. for parent
	.DS_Store which is something about macs
	.git directory

Git & GitHub
